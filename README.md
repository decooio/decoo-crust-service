# Decoo Crust Service

This is a RESTful API service based on [Crust](https://wiki.crust.network) Maxwell network RPC calls. Under the hood, it uses [polkadot.js](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) and [crust.js](https://github.com/crustio/crust.js) to interact with Crust chains.

The main purpose of this service is to provide a language agnostic API interface to facilitate access to Crust network, which can be consumed by a broad range of clients via Http protocol.
